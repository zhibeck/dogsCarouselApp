Getting Started
Hey there! Welcome to DoorDash's frontend interview!

The purpose of this exercise is for you to build a slideshow that displays the top N images returned from Reddit's /r/dogswithjobs subreddit!

The goal here is not to purely demonstrate your coding ability, we're here to give you a problem that's not totally spec'd out for you, and we want to see how far you can go.

How good can you make it without much guidance?
What are the sort of improvements and choices you'll make as you build this, and where do your priorities lie?

In the interest of time, we are providing the basic functionality for fetching the images from the reddit channel, check the dogapi.js file for more details.

Remember, building stuff is supposed to be fun, so be creative! Happy coding!
